          <p>  For my undergraduate research under the mentorship of Dr. Freelon, I sought out to gather data on the 
            influence of “airdrop seeders” within the Twitter crypto-space. An airdrop is a form of crypto advertisement
             on Twitter where a tweet rewards users who reply to the tweet by mentioning other users. The reward comes in 
             the form of the crypto token being advertised. “Airdrop seeders”, who are the users behind these advertisements,
              often ask for other users to reply to the airdrop tweet by tagging three other users. Dr. Freelon observed this 
              occurrence and was curious as to how much Twitter crypto spaces consisted of airdrops and what caused this 
              phenomenon. This is the question my research attempted to answer. I collected one million tweets (between the
               dates 02/01/2022 -> 01/31/2023) with the keywords “Smartchain”, “Nft”, “Airdrop”, or “Crypto”. I then iterated 
               through all of these tweets to see which ones were the most popular based on retweet count. Out of the most 100
                popular users I scraped 1000 replies to each user. The replies were from the time of their tweet in the dataset
                 of one million tweets. For each user's replies, I checked for the amount of replies which contained three mentions 
                 or more and no other text. While at this step of my research, I manually checked all the parent tweets of 
                 which were popular by retweet count and contained three mention replies and found ones which were not airdrops. 
                 The non airdrop tweets fit into several crypto or NFT categories. These categories were presale/listing 
                 announcement, NFT competition, troubleshooting, partnership announcement, and public relations/ads. After 
                 doing this manual check, it was evident that most of my popular users were in fact airdrops. I then gathered 
                 30 of the most popular users that had made an airdrop in my data and scraped up to 1000 replies which mentioned 
                 any of these users for each day over the timeframe of the data I have (02/01/22 -> 01/31/23). I then turned this 
                 data into a longitudinal line plot upon which I could adjust the lines to depict volume of different numbers of 
                 mentions. On the aforementioned line plot, each day analyzes up to 1,000 replies. Therefore, the entire plot 
                 summarizes ~365k tweets across time (if all possible numbers of mentions volumes are depicted). I then utilized 
                 these plots to analyze how the fluctuations of airdrop activity (3-mention replies) correlate with other events 
                 in the crypto world.
